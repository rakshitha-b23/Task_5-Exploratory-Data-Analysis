# 🛳 Titanic Data Analysis Project

This project is a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.  
The goal is to understand survival patterns based on factors like **Age, Gender, Fare, and Passenger Class (Pclass)** using data visualization and correlation analysis.

## 📑 Steps Followed

1. **Imported** Titanic dataset (`train_data`).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Histograms** to observe Age, Fare, and Pclass distributions.
   - **Count plots** to explore categorical features (e.g., Sex, Survived, Pclass).
   - **Scatter plots** for relationships (e.g., Fare vs Pclass, Survival).
   - **Correlation heatmap** for understanding numeric feature relationships.
   - **Pairplots** to visualize multi-variable interactions (Survival, Age, Fare, Pclass).
3. **Analyzed** feature distributions and missing values.
4. **Generated Insights**:
   - Patterns based on demographics (age, sex).
   - Fare impact on survival.
   - Class distribution and survival analysis.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Females** had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **1st class passengers** had higher survival rates compared to lower classes.
- **Higher fares** were linked with better survival chances.
- **Age distribution** centered around 20–30 years; younger passengers slightly more likely to survive.
- **Fare distribution** was highly skewed — most fares were low, a few were very high.
- **Strong negative correlation** between Fare and Pclass (higher class → higher fare).
